# Moderno CSS Framework

## Overview

Moderno is a simple CSS framework designed to simplify the web design process. The framework focuses on typography, form elements, and interactive components to provide a seamless user experience. The CSS framework supplies basic styles and takes an opinion about what looks good on the web and how styles should be applied. The framework is very adaptable, allowing for straightforward customization to fit your specific design needs.
